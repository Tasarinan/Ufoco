## What is it?

What does ufoco mean? It's timer manager tool or todo list or work planner or others. I dont know. I only can tell you it is built with web technologies but it is focused on what you really matters now! It is so versatile that you'll have not problem using it for any scenario,but bascially I am appriciated if it can help you improve your efficency and to be a good sidekiff.

## Project purpose

During the past ten years, to help my work productivity and efficiency. I have used many tools,these tools have helped me from different domain, like **Evernote**, **typora**,**workflowy** can help me writting. Anki and [flash card](https://www.jackkinsella.ie/articles/janki-method) can help me improve memory. Pomodoro timer manager tool(dida tick) can help me manage time. but I still failed to improve my life and work. The most important reason is because I didnt understand what's really care about in my life. Could we ask me one question like Job steven? "if today is my last day, do we really need do this work?".For now only using a tool does not mean I can understand what should I do today or future.Maybe what I have pursued was not clear for me. Do I really need a tool to manage my self. No, We should manage ourself by staying organized, staying informed. We need better organized firstly.

> **[Staying Organized](https://www.wikihow.com/Stay-Organized) and Staying informed**

- With this product, all things can be organized by machine and optimized by AI. all things can be informed at specific time by machine. What you should do is to execute this and complete this.

## Motivation

The product philosophy of Ufoco is LESS equals MORE. It doesnâ€™t matter where we put ours thoughts, ideas and to-dos down. What really counts is that we actually do that eventually - go back to my thoughts and work out some problems; continue my new idea and make it big; or just simply get everything listed done. The way how we put the jobs down should be as simple as possible. And this simple way, with your job is the LESS, which might bring your something MORE than you have imagined.
