Lesson 79 Carve Her Name With Pride (¢ñ)

   Potter:   Good morning, my name's Potter. Come in and sit down, won't you?
   Voilette: Thank you.
   Potter:   Well, I suppose you're wondering why I sent for you?
   Voilette: I expect it's about the pension.
   Potter:   I understand you're partly French, Mrs. Szabo.
   Violette: My mother was French.
   Potter:   And your husband was in the French army.
   Violette: Yes. He was killed at El Alamein, six months ago.
   Potter:   Yes ... yes, I know. I'm sorry. You ... mm ... you speak French yourself, of course?
   Violette: Yes, I was brought up to speak French and English.
   Potter:   And you're quite an athlete, I'm told. And you're something of a crack shot with a rifle.
   Violette: Mr. Potter, if it's about the pension, then I really don't see...
   Potter:   Well, actually, Mrs. Szabo, it's not about the pension.
   Violette: But you wrote to me.
   Potter:   Yes, I know. Ministry of Pensions. That's not correct. I belong to quite a different department.
   Violette: Well, if it's not about the pension, why am I here?
   Potter:   Because I think that you have certain qualifications which might be of great use.
   Violette: Qualifications? What for?
   Potter:   The war effort. I must tell you at once, it comes under the heading of "Dangerous Work."
   Violette: Look, I ... I really don't think you've got hold of the right person. What kind of work?
   Potter:   Well ... briefly ... we're doing everything we can to make things as difficult for the Germans as we can. In every way we can. From blowing up their troop trains to ... er ... putting chalk into their ink. The French are magnificent. Of course. But they have to be organized, and supplied. We need liaison people. It's quite a job.
   Violette: Yes, yes, I ... I suppose it is.
   Potter:   One more thing. The Germans don't like what we're doing. They don't like it at all. In certain circumstances, they'll react violently. And brutally. We now, are you interested?
   Violette: I don't know ... I don't know.
   Potter:   Since your husband died you've rather shut yourself away from everybody, haven't you? Oh, we have to make some fairly close enquiries before we interview people for this sort of work.
   Violette: Oh, yes, I see. Well, I just couldn't seem to face up to things.
   Potter:   Quite. But you're picking up the threads again now, aren't you?
   Violette: I'm trying to.
   Potter:   Good. Well, I'd like you to turn this over in your mind.
   Violette: I ... I... I'm sorry, Mr. Potter, I ... I ... I really don't think I can be of any use to you.
   Potter:   I suppose you're thinking about your baby?
   Violette: She's all I have. What if anything happened to me?
   Potter:   Yes, of course. Well, that's something you must think about. But, you don't have to make up your mind right away. Why don't you come and see me again in a week's time.
   Violette: Yes, yes, yes, all right, if you wish.
   Potter:   You do realize that you must tell nobody about this interview ... nobody at all. Mot even your parents.
   Violette: Yes, of course. Mr. Potter, wouldn't it be possible to find someone else for this job?
   Potter:   I don't know. It might be possible. But you see it's taken us a long time to find you. There are so few people with your qualifications. Oh, just a moment. Don't forget your pass, otherwise you'll be here for ever.
Lesson 80  Carve Her Name With Pride (¢ò)

   Vera Atkins:  Oh, good afternoon. My name's Vera Atkins. I'm looking for Mrs. Szabo.
   Violette:     Oh, that's me. Will you come in?
   Vera Atkins:  Thank you. You don't know me, but I'm working in the same department as Mr. Potter.
   Violette:     Oh, would you come in here, please.
   Vera Atkins:  Thank you. Mr. Potter got you letter. He just wanted me to see you to make sure you understand the step you're taking.
   Violette:     Well, I've thought about it for two weeks and ... I know now it's the only thing I can do.
   Vera Atkins:  You realize your decision is entirely voluntary. No pressure will be used.
   Violette:     I still want to join.
   Vera Atkins:  Good.
   Violette:     Will you sit down?
   Vera Atkins:  Thank you. Oh, what a dear little girl. It's Tania, isn't it?
   Violette:     Yes.
   Vere Atkins:  How old is she?
   Violette:     Just over two.
   Vera Atkins:  And yet you still want to do this?
   Violette:     My husband was killed fighting in the desert. For his sake, I ... i couldn't live the rest of my life ... knowing I'd failed to do my bit. He never saw Tania. But I suppose in a way he was fighting for her. And now it's my turn.
   Vera Atkins:  You do realize it may end the same way for you?
   Violette:     Yes, I do realize that.
   Vera Atkins:  Right. The first thing to do is to get you into uniform. Then you won't be asked awkward questions about what you're doing. You'll be commissioned as an officer in "Fannies". Can You start at once?
   Violette:     Oh, yes, my mother will look after Tania.
   vera Atkins:  Good.

   Vera Atkins:  Yes, that's right.

Lesson 100  Canada

   Canada has pieces of landscape to match every spot on the globe, except tropical jungle. In 1867, they joined the pieces together and made a new nation of it. And they kept adding to it until 1949 when they finally talked Newfoundland into joining her.
   Since there are 3,851,809 square miles of it, you can't see too much in one trip, but you can get an idea.
   All sorts of visitors come to Toronto, and the people of Toronto like to make them feel right at home. 
   Canadians are very proud of their sophisticated industries and make things like the fastest autogiro in the world. They are very good at making vehicles of various sorts because they still have to spend much of their time getting from place to place.
   Certain parties in the rest of the world still think Canada consists mainly of fur-bearing animals and the people who trap them. Of all the animals to choose from, the Canadians pick the beaver as their national animal, the creature whose one outstanding characteristic is stubbornness.
   However, if the majority of Canadians were once trappers, most of them have gone on to other pursuits.
   Canadians have a lot of space to fill. They can't have cities everywhere. ... This city's on wheels. When nobody wants to live here any more, they just move the town away. There are companies who rent towns like this. They'll rent you one for about 5,000 dollars a week and deliver it anywhere in he world.
   On the other hand, there are places in Canada which stay put and everybody comes to visit.
   The Indians called it "the Great Thunder." It is their legend that, when Princess Lelowalo was sacrificed to Niagara, she floated calmly over the falls in a white birch canoe dressed in soft doe-skin with a garland of flowers in her hair.
   It has been said that the west coast is more British than the British. But it is also a land of exceptional exceptions. There's nothing British about Mr Nikolas. "I think I will build a Greek island in Canada," Nikolas said one day. And eighteen years later, he proved that all things are possible if you go far enough west.
   It has been said that Canada is the oldest underdeveloped country in the world, that she has the size of China with the population of Iran, that she has the cultural development of Afghanistan, the economic structure of the Congo, and the climate of Siberia. But the people who see these things are Canadians. The rest of the world seems to like her. She is generally good-natured. From all we've been able to see of her, she looks just fine.

Lesson 118   Martin Luther King: Lincoln Memorial Address

   The Lincoln Memorial Address was delivered by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. on August 28, 1963. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964. Dr. King, the famous civil rights leader in the 1960s, was assassinated in 1968.
   Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of bad captivity.
   But one hundred years later, the Negro still is not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. One hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later, the Negro is still languished in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land. So we've come here today to dramatize a shameful condition.
   I am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and tribulations. Some of you have come fresh from narrow jail cells. Some of you have come from areas where you quest for freedom left you battered by the storms of persecution and staggered by the winds of police brutality. You have been the veterans of creative suffering. Continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive.
   Go back to Mississippi, go back to Alabama, go back to South Carolina, go back to Georgia, go back to Louisiana, go back to the slums and ghettos of our northern cities, knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed. let us not wallow in the valley of despair.
   I say to you today, my friends, so even though we  face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.  
   I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up, live up to the true meaning of its creed: "We hold these truths to be self-evident; that all men are created equal."
   I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave-owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.
   I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.
   I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.
   I have a dream today.
   I have a dream that one day down in Alabama with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification, one day right down in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.
   I have a dream today. 
   I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight, and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together.
   This is our hope. This is the faith that I go back to the South with. With this faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain of the despair a stone of hope. With this faith we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood. With this faith we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day.
   This will be the day when all of God's children will be able to sing with new meaning --
   My country, 'tis of thee,
   Sweet land of liberty,
   Of thee I sing:
   Land where my fathers died,
   Land of the pilgrims' pride,
   From every mountainside
   Let freedom ring.
   And if America is to be a great nation this must become true. So let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire.
   Let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York!
   Let freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania!
   Let freedom ring from the snowcapped Rockies of Colorado!
   Let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of California!
   But not only that; let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia!
   Let freedom ring from Lookout Mountain of Tennessee!
   Let freedom ring from every hill and molehill of Mississippi!
   From every mountainside, let freedom ring!
   When we let freedom ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God's children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual, "Free at last! free at last! thank God almighty, we are free at last!"

Lesson 119  Cross-Country Derby And Cross-Country Skiing

   In many towns across New England, the cross-country derby has become a traditional winter event. In the Stowe Derby, everyone participates, young and old, novice and expert.
   "Five, four, three, two, one, go!"
   The course for the Stowe Derby is 16 kilometers through meadow, farmland, over hills, through fields, and finally, into the center of town.
   They race against the clock, not each other and there are no prizes waiting at the finish-line -- just a good cheer of their neighbours and the exhilarating satisfaction reserved for the cross-country skier.
   New England's Green Mountains. In winter, it is a world of silence, unseen, impenetrable.
   This is the exclusive winter domain of the cross-country skier. Cross-country skiing is just that, skiing over hills, across frozen lakes and valleys, through farmland and forest, anywhere there is snow. You take off when you feel like it, and at your own pace. It doesn't matter how you look or whether you fall down. Cross-country skiing is between you and the winter.
   The Trappe Family Lodge in Stowe, Vermont, the first cross-country ski center in America opened here in 1972. Practiced in Europe for centuries, it is only in recent years that cross-country skiing has caught on in the United States.
   Enthusiasts are attracted by its comfortable lightweight equipment, and down-hill skiers find it's safer and less expensive.
   To master the graceful Nordic stride, the experienced skier need only watch the experts. But for the beginner, a few hours of instruction are needed to get a feel for the skis.
   Mitzi Kane is racing for an Olympic gold, a member of the United States Ski Team. She trains for the Winter Olympic Games by burning up 50 kilometers of ski trail each day.
   Americans have begun to do well in cross-country competition. Mitzi feels the key to winning at the 1980 Olympics in nearby Lake Placid in New York is conditioning and determination.
   "So much of it's mental as well as physical. It's in pushing your body and your mind beyond what you would normally do in everyday life. And it makes it, so that when you finish a race, you really feel it's a rewarding ... . It's like you feel like you've accomplished something."
Lesson 120   Dodge City

   Dodge City, Kansas, 1870.
   Through countless movies, TV shows and pulp novels, the name Dodge City has become a legend -- the widest cow town in the western frontier.
   Much of the mythology surrounding old Dodge City centers on the town lawmen. Wyatt Earp and Bat Mastersor were real peace officers in early Dodge City. On television, Marshal Matt Dillon has thrown more outlaws in jail than a cactus has thorns.
   The modern day counterpart to these legendary lawmen is Dodge City's Chief of Police Oakley Ralf.
   Like the city itself, a lawman's life has changed considerably over the years. An occasional desperado needs rounding up. But Chief Ralf spends most of his time working on department administration for Community Relations -- a term that might have made a frontier sheriff choke in this beer.
   In 1878, Dodge City's population was about 600. Today, it's 15,000. The city has a new Civic Center and two colleges. Of course, while it's true that Dodge City is keeping pace with modern times, its citizens aren't about to forget her well-known history.
   At the foot of Boot Hill, Dodge City's famous old Front Street is reproduced just as it was in 1872. There's a museum, an apothecary shop, a frontier doctor's office, old fort Dodge Jail. And if you're thirsty, you could still get a glass of soda pop at the Long Branch Saloon.
   Back in the 1800s, a cold drink wasn't the only comfort sough at the local saloon by trail-weary cowpokes. And while it's true there were a few career women in the old West, most  were kept corralled at home.
   Today in Dodge City, a woman's place is anywhere she wants. Nancy Trower decided that she wanted to be in the City Commission -- the town's governing body. She campaigned for the office and was elected. The other members of the City Commission voted Nancy Mayor of Dodge City recently and she now serves as the city's chief elected official.
   One of the few things that has not changed much through the years is the nature of Dodge City's economy. During the frontier's great cattle era, Dodge became a major shipping point for trail herds. Its growth depended on the value of agriculture in general and cattle in particular.
   Today, cattle-raising is still the biggest industry, but the ranchers who buy and raise cattle are a new breed. Harold Poe, for example. With a college degree in agriculture, Poe spends much of his time in town rather than in the fields. He lives in Dodge City and works in a local bank.
   Cattlemen like Harold Poe buy most of their animals at auctions. Dodge City has two such large stock outlets and they run full the year round. There is also a busy packing plant which dresses and packages beef.
   Dodge City has changed just as other small towns in western America have changed. 
   There's a big difference between this city's past and present. Like a wise, old Kansas' cowhand, Dodge City holds on to just enough of both.

Lesson 99  Australia

   Australia -- a huge island continent that lies to the south of Asia. Australians -- a varied people in size, colour and origins. Australia -- more than two hundred years old, a nation that is still growing. 
   Its big cities lie on the southeast coast, this is where most Australians live. Australians prefer to own their own houses, though some live in apartments. Australians are a suburban people. The suburbs surround the cities for many miles, and so efficient transport is of great importance. As the economy grows, so do its industries -- a higher level of production, a wider range of products. 
   The Australian works hard, but he likes his leisure. The climate makes outdoor activities the most popular.
   Canberra, the capital of Australia, is a planned modern city located inland. Australia is governed by a parliamentary democracy. The representatives of other countries have their embassies here. Australia wants to strengthen relations with her neighbours.
   Australia is a strange land, a land of vast expanses -- fertile valleys, snow fields and deserts -- also a land with unique animals, many that can not be found on any other continent in the world today.
   Much of the continent is dry, but man has utilized the land, made it productive, with its tools, with its technology. This is the driest continent of all, and water is a precious possession, more precious than all other natural resources. Large dams are built to collect the water, which is then channelled down to the plains below -- there to irrigate the fields of pastures and crops.
   But Australia is changing. The land of wool and wheat is now a land of large-scale industry and mining. The costs of developing the new mineral discoveries are enormous, but the rewards are great too.
   Australia -- a young and developing nation. Australia -- a nation that wants to communicate with its neighbours.

   Notes
   The preference given to the eldest son and his descendants in the inheritance of property, or position, or both, is called primogeniture. The opposite of primogeniture is ultimogeniture -- preferential inheritance by the youngest son or child. The Stature of Wills, which became part of the English law in 1540, made it possible by will to negate primogeniture.

   Customs are the acquired ways of behaving which control thought and action, manners and morals within a group. Customs are the "do's" and "don't's" of social life.
   Man learns the customs of his society so well that customs often become habits. Like habits for the individual, customs for the group are done without thought.
   Customs are always changing: old ones disappear, and new ones become accepted.

   For a long period in human history, and also in a large part of the world, women were regarded as inferior to men physically and intellectually. But women have been fighting for their political, social, and educational equality for many years. The latest feminism was in the 60s, known also as Women's Liberation movement, which occurred mainly in the U.K. and in the U.S. The U.S. National Organization for Women (NOW) and other groups pressed for such changes as abortion reform, federally supported childcare centers, equal pay, the occupational upgrading, and the removal of all legal and social barriers to women's education.

   Notes
   In former times, the property that a bride brought with her to marriage was called her dowry. It was believed that a substantial dowry would enhance the bride's position as a spouse, strengthen inter-family ties, and serve as a financial base for the newlyweds. Although dowries are no longer common in most of the societies now, the bride's parents often pay the wedding expenses.

   Notes
   The word for "tea" in all languages can be traced to the word "cha' in Chinese, which bears out the belief that tea was originated in China. Various countries have made  use of tea in vastly different ways, according to the indigenous cultures and needs of each.
   In 1800, Anna, the 7th Duchess of Bedford, invented "teatime" because she claimed to get a "sinking feeling" around 5 p.m. The English have preserved this tradition of having "tea", which has become perhaps the most enjoyable meal of the day.

   Camping -- in the proper sense of the word -- with tents, is not so well developed in England as in France, because the summer weather can often be very unpleasant for tent-dwellers. On the other hand, caravans (or "trailers" as they are called in America) have become exceedingly popular in England. Some people bring their own caravans, pulling them behind their cars; others hire caravans already in position.

   Under the National Health Service in Britain, each person is free to choose a general practitioner in the area where he lives. Every general practitioner receives a fixed "capitation" payment from the Health Service funds of about one pound per year for each patient on his list. An average doctor has a little over 2,000 people on his list; the maximum is around 3,500. Out of his earnings he must provide a waiting room and a consulting room for his patients. In towns, it is usual for three or four general practitioners to join together in partnership.

   Life span, or life expectancy, is measured either as the maximum age achieved by a member or as an average among the population. The former reveals the genetic potential, whereas the latter reflects the habitability of the environment and is thus considered meaningful.
   Human beings are the longest-living mammals and among the longest-living of all animals. In 1978, the highest authenticated age was 113.

   Notes
   Influenza is an acute and highly contagious disease caused by a filterable virus. Since it resembles many common respiratory ailments, it is usually difficult to diagnose in absence of an epidemic. Although sporadic cases do occur, epidemics of influenza, sometimes worldwide in scope, can affect a large population. For example, in 1918, more than 20 million people were hit by influenza.

   The first electronic digital computer was completed in 1946 at the University of Pennsylvania. The first-generation computers were supplanted by the transistorized computers of the late 50s and early 60s. The second-generation machines that could perform a million operations per second were replaced by the third-generation integrated-circuit machines of the mid-60s and 70s. The 80s has been characterized by the development of the microprocessors and the evolution of increasingly smaller but powerful minicomputers, microcomputers, and personal computers.

   Colours may be grouped according to the way they make people feel: cool and warm. The cool colours are blue or mainly blue in cast. The warm colours are red or mainly red and yellow. People often feel cold in a blue room and warn in a red room, yet they may not know that it is the colours that make them feel this way.

   Joanna: Ted, I'm leaving you. Ted, keys. Here are my keys. Here's my American Express Card. Here's my Bloomingdale's Credit Card. Here's my check book. I've taken 2,000 dollars out of our savings account because that's what I had in the bank when we first got married.
   Ted:    What's this -- some kind of joke?
   Joanna: Here's the cleaning. Here's the laundry ticket. You can pick them both up on Saturday. You, you have to pick them up  on Saturday.
   Ted:    So you want to tell me what's the matter?
   Joanna: I've paid the rent. I've paid the Con-Ed Bill and I've paid the phone bill. So ...
   Ted:    Well you really fixed your time so? Well, I am sorry that I was late, but I was busy making a living. All right? Come on. O.K.? Can we stop now?
   Joanna: That's everything.
   Ted:    Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey ... Enough, enough, all right? What are you doing? Where are you going? Come on. Just tell me what I did. That's all. Just tell me what I did that's so terrible?
   Joanna: It's not you. It's not you.
   Ted:    Then what is it?
   Joanna: It's me. My fault. You just married the wrong person, that's all. ...
   Ted:    O.K. ... Let's just go inside, please.
   Joanna: I can't. I've tired ...
   Ted:    Joanna, please. Now just ... I'm sorry.
   Joanna: Now don't! Don't make me go in there please! Please, don't make me go in there! Don't make me go in there!
   Ted:    Let's just talk ...
   Joanna: If you do, I swear one day, next week, maybe next year, I don't know, I'll go right out of the window.
   Ted:    Oh please, come on now ... What about Billy?
   Joanna: I'm not taking him with me. I'm no good for him. I'm terrible with him. I have no patience. He's better off without me.
   Ted:    Joanna, please.
   Joanna: And I don't love you anymore.
   Ted:    Where are you going?
   Joanna: I don' know.

   (In Billy's bedroom)
   Ted:   Hey, Billy! Billy! Told you Mommy'd write before the week's up.
   Billy: When's she coming back?
   Ted:   Now, hold your horses. That's what we're going to find out right now. O.K. Read it. 'My dearest, sweet Billy.' You. 'Mommy has gone away. Sometimes in the world Daddies go away and Mommies bring up their little boys. But sometimes a Mommy can go away too. And, and you have your Daddy to bring you up. I have gone away because I must find something interesting to do for myself in the world. Everybody has to and so do I. Being a Mommy was one thing but there are other things too. And this is what I have to do. I did not get a chance to tell you this and that is why I'm writing you now. I will always be your Mommy and I will always love you. I just won't be your Mommy in the house. But I'll be your Mommy at the heart. And now ... (Billy turns on the TV. Noise comes over from the TV advertisement ...) We're going to read this another time, O.K.?
   Billy: Don't care.

   (Telephone rings)
   Ted:    Louise, you want to get that? Louise, it's ringing, honey. (To the phone) Yeah, hello. Yes, Who is it? Joanna?!
   (In a coffee shop)
   Ted:    Hi!
   Joanna: Hi!
   Ted:    How are you?
   Joanna: You look great. How's your ...
   Ted:    What?
   Joanna: Er ...
   Ted:    I'm sorry.
   Joanna: Oh, I was just going to say how's your job?
   Ted:    Fine, fine. Vice-president of nothing . ...
   Waitress: Excuse me, would you like a drink?
   Ted:    (To the waitress) Whatever she's having.
   Joanna: White wine.
   Ted:    Wine.
   Joanna: How's Billy?
   Ted:    He's terrific. Oh, he ... er ... had an accident, couple of weeks ago on the playground and cut himself. It was really scary. I ran him all the way to the hospital. He's got a little teeny scar but he'll be fine. I, I've been worrying that's my fault.
   Joanna: No, don't do that! Can't even see it from a distance. I ... Sometimes I sit in that coffee shop across the street from his school and watch him. He's got so big.
   Ted:    You've been watching him from the coffee shop?
   Joanna: Well, I've been in New York for about two monthe now, so ...
   Ted:    I didn't know.
   Joanna: Anyway. So I wanted to talk to you today, because er... last time you saw me, I was in a pretty bad ... really bad ...
   Ted:    Shape.
   Joanna: Shape, yes. I was.
   Ted:    Well, you look, you look lovely now.
   Joanna: Ah. 
   Ted:    What?
   Joanna: I have a whole speech.
   Ted:    Now, go ahead.
   Joanna: Er ..., I know all my life I've, I've left like somebody's wife, or somebody's mother, or somebody's daughter. Even all the time we were together, I never knew who I was. And that's why I had to go away. And in California, I think I found myself. And I got myself a job, I got myself a therapist, a really good one. And, and I feel better about myself than I ever have in my whole life. And I've learned a great deal about myself?
   Ted:    Such as? No, I'm really ... I'd, I'd really like to know what you've learned?
   Joanna: Well, I've learned that I love ... my little boy, and that I'm capable of taking care of him.
   Ted:    What do you mean?
   Joanna: I want my son.
   Ted:    You can't have him.
   Joanna: Don't get defensive. Don't ... don't try to bully me.
   Ted:    I'm not getting defensive. Who walked out of the house 15 months ago?
   Joanna: I can't care.
   Ted:    Joan...
   Joanna: I am still his mother.
   Ted:    Yes, and 3,000 miles away and just because you've sent him a few postcards. It gives you the right to come back here?
   Joanna: I never stop wanting him, and loving him.
   Ted:    What makes you so sure he wants you?
   Joanna: What makes you so sure he doesn't want me?
   Ted:    O.K. We're going to sit here and bat his back and forth like it was for eight years. That seems just like old times ...
   Joanna: Well, you can't deny me. I am still his mommy.
   Ted:    Don't tell me what I can or cannot do. Don't talk to me that way.
   Joanna: I anticipated that something ...
   Ted:    O.K. I don't want to ... You are going to have to do what you are going to have to do, I'm going to have to do what I...
   Joanna: I'm very sorry about this. 
   Ted:    O.K. You can just do what you have to do.
Lesson 140  Kramer vs. Kramer (¢ò)

   (In the courtroom)
   Bailiff:    Ohyeah, ohyeah! Persons having business with the Supreme Court State of New York, Special Term Part ¢õ, draw nigh and you shall be heard. This court is now in session. Judge Atkins presiding. All rise.
   Judge:      Is the attorney for the petitioner ready?
   Attorney 1: I am, Your Honor. As my first witness, I'd like to call Joanna Kramer.
   Bailiff:    Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth you've got?
   Joanna:     I do.
   Attorney 1: Now then, Mrs Kramer, would you tell the court how long you were married?
   Joanna:     Eight years.
   Attorney 1: And would you describe those years as happy?
   Joanna:     The first two, yes. But after that, it became increasingly difficult.
   Attorney 1: Mrs Kramer, did you hold a job before you were married?
   Joanna:     Yes, I did. When I first got out of Smith, I worked in the Art Department of Mademoiselle magazine for several years.
   Attorney 1: Did you continue to work after you were married?
   Joanna:     No, I did not.
   Attorney 1: Did you wish to?
   Joanna:     Yes. But every time I talked to Ted, to my ex-husband, about it, he wouldn't listen. He refused to discuss it in any serious way. I remember once he said that I probably couldn't get a job that would pay enough to hire a baby-sitter for Billy.
   Attorney 1: Tell me are you employed at the present time?
   Joanna:     Yes, I am a sportswear designer for Zelco here in New York.
   Attorney 1: And what is your present salary?
   Joanna:     I make 31,000 dollars a year.
   Attorney 1: Mrs Kramer, do you love your child?
   Joanna:     Yes, I do. Very much.
   Attorney 1: And yet you chose to leave him.
   Joanna:     Yes. Oh, look. During the last five years of our marriage, I was becoming more and more unhappy, more and more troubled. And I really needed somebody to help me. But when I turned to Ted he just wasn't there for me. So we became more and more isolated from one another, more and more separate. He was very involved in his career. And because of his attitude towards my fears and his inability to deal with my feelings, I had come to have almost no self-esteem. I was scared and I was very unhappy. And in my mind I had no other choice but to leave. At the time I left, I felt that there was something terribly wrong with me and that my son would be better off without me. And it was only after I got to California that I realized, after getting into therapy, that I wasn't such a terrible person. And just because I needed some kind of creative role and emotional outlet other than my child, that didn't make me unfit to be a mother.
   Attorney 1: Your Honor, I would like to submit in evidence a report by Mrs Kramer's, therapist Dr. Eleanor Freeman.
   Attorney 2: Objection, you honor. The report is irrelevant and immaterial and not binding on the respondent.
   Judge:      Overruled.
   Attorney 1: Mrs Kramer, can you tell the court why you are asking for custody?
   Joanna:     Because he's my child and because I love him. I know I left my son. I know that that's a terrible  thing to do. Believe me I have to live with that every day of my life. But in order to leave him, I had to believe that it was the only thing I could do, and that it was the best thing for him. I was incapable of functioning in that home, and I didn't know what the alternative was going to be. So I thought it was not best that I take him with me. However I have since gotten some help and I have worked very, very hard to become a whole human being. And I don't think I should be  punished for that. And I don't think my little boy should be punished. Billy's only seven years old. He needs me. I am not saying that he doesn't need his father. But I really believe he needs me more. I was his Mommy for five and a half years and Ted took over the role for 18 months. But I don't know how anybody can possibly believe that I have less of a stake in mothering that little boy than Mr Kramer does. I'm his mother. I'm his mother.
   Attorney 1: Thank you, Mrs Kramer. I have no further questions.

   Red Cross is an international organization concerned with alleviating the suffering and promoting public health. It was formed in 1863 on the urging of Jean Henry Dunant, a Swiss citizen who had witnessed the suffering at the battle of Solferino (1859). The Geneva Convention of 1864 adopted the red cross as a symbol of neutral aid. Today there are over 100 national Red Cross societies and two international bodies based in Geneva.

   Futurology is the study of social trends in society in order to forecast the future. Most futurologists are social scientists who try to estimate what the society of the year 2000 or 2100 may be like. In the Next 200 years, Herman Kann forecasts a future with stable population, rising standard of living, and unlimited energy sources.

   The first organized system of post offices in America was created by the British Parliament in 1711 and the mails were carried over post roads. Postage stamps were first used in the U.S. in 1847. The postal savings system started in 1911, and parcel post in 1913. Mail service by railroad was instituted in 1862, and airmail in 1918.
   The U.S. Postal Service now operates as an independent agency within the government, with the goal of becoming self-supporting by 1984; it has operated at a deficit for many years.

   Noise intensity is measured in decibel units. Subjected to 45 decibels of noise, the average person cannot sleep. Hearing damage begins at about 85 decibels. Exposure to excessive noise can cause hearing loss, lack of sleep, irritability, heartburn, indigestion, ulcers, high blood pressure, and possible heart disease. But noise is now recognized as a controllable pollutant that can yield to abatement technology.

   In Britain Meals on Wheels is the name of a service whereby meals are prepared in some central place and then delivered in a van (i.e. 'on wheels') to individual old people in their own homes. Usually the old people pay a small sum for the food, but the delivery is made by unpaid voluntary workers (the Women's Voluntary Service).

UNIT 80   PLAY

Lesson 159 Death Of A Salesman (¢ñ)
 
   Arthur Miller (1915 -- ) is one of the most widely discussed American playwrights since the Second World War. His masterpiece, Death of A Salesman (1949), is the story of an ordinary American destroyed by hollow values.

   Main Characters in the play:
   Willy Loman   A salesman
   Linda         Willy's wife
   Biff          elder son
   Happy         younger son

   The following scene is taken from Act One.
   Light has risen on the boys' room. Biff gets out of bed, comes downstage a bit, and stands attentively. Biff is two years older than his brother Happy, well built, but in these days bears a worn air and seems less-assured. He has succeeded less, and his dreams are stronger and less acceptable than Happy's. Happy is tall, powerfully made. He, like his brother, is lost, but in a different way, for he has never allowed himself to turn his face toward defeat and is thus more confused and hard-skinned, although seemingly more content.

   Biff:  Why does Dad mock me all the time?
   Happy: He's not mocking you, he
   Biff:  Everything I say there's a twist of mockery on his face. I can't get near him.
   Happy: He just wants you to make good, that's all. I wanted to talk to you about Dad for a long time, Biff. Something's -- happening to him. He -- talks to himself.
   Biff:  I notice that this morning. But he always mumbled.
   Happy: But not so noticeable. It got so embarrassing I had to send him to Florida. And you know something? Most of the time he's talking to you.
   Biff:  What's he say about me?
   Happy: I can't make it out.
   Biff:  What does he say about me?
   Happy: I think the fact that you're not settled, that you're still kind of up in the air ...
   Biff:  There's one or two other things depressing him, Happy.
   Happy: What do you mean?
   Biff:  Never mind. Just don't lay it all to me.
   Happy: But I think if you just got started -- I mean -- is there any future for you out there?
   Biff:  I tell ya, Hap, I don't know what the future is. I don't know -- what I'm supposed to want.
   Happy: What do you mean?
   Biff:  Well, I spent six or seven years after high school trying to work myself up. Shipping clerk, salesman, business of one kind or another. And it's a measly manner of existence. To get on that subway on the hot mornings in summer. To devote your whole life to keeping stock, or making phone calls, or buying or selling. To suffer fifty weeks out of the year for the sake of a two-week vacation, when all you really desire is to be outdoors, with your shirt off. And always to have to get ahead of the next fella. And still -- that's how you build a future.
   Happy: Well, you really enjoy it on a farm? Are you content out there?
   Biff:  [with rising agitation:] Hap, I've had twenty or thirty different kinds of jobs since I left home before the war, and it always turns out the same. I just realized it lately. In Nebraska when I herded cattle, and in Dakotas, and Arizona, and now in Texas. It's why I came home now, I guess, because I realized it. This farm I work on, it's spring there now, see? And they've got about fifteen new colts. There's nothing more inspiring or -- beautiful than the sight of a mare and a new colt. And it's cool there now, see? Texas is cool now, and it's spring. And whenever spring comes to where I am, I suddenly get the feeling, my God, I'm not getting anywhere! What the hell am I doing, playing around with horses, twenty-eight dollars a week! I'm thirty-four years old, I oughta be makin' my future. That's why I come running home. And now, I get here, and I don't know what to do with myself. [After a pause:] I've always made a point of not wasting my life, and everytime I come back here I know that all I've done is to waste my life.
   Happy: You're a poet, you know that, Biff? You're a -- you're an idealist!
   Biff:  No, no, no, I'm mixed up very bad. Maybe I oughta get married. Maybe I oughta get stuck into something. Maybe that's my trouble. I'm like a boy. I'm not married. I'm not in business, I just -- I'm like a boy. Are you content, Hap? You're a success, aren't you? Are you content?
   Happy: Hell, no!
   Biff:  Why? You're making money, aren't you?
   Happy: [moving about with energy, expressiveness:] All I can do now is wait for the merchandise manager to die. And suppose I become merchandise manager? He's a good friend of mine, and he just built a terrific estate on Long Island. And he lived there about two months and he sold it, and now he's building another one. He can't enjoy it once it's finished. And I know that's just what I would do. I don't know what the hell I'm workin' for. Sometimes I sit in my apartment -- all alone. And I thing of the rent I'm paying. And it's crazy. But then, it's what I always wanted. My own apartment, a car, and plenty of women. And still, goddammit, I'm lonely.
   Biff:  [with enthusiasm:] Listen, why don't you come out West with me?
   Happy: You and me, heh?
   Biff:  Sure, we, we could buy a ranch maybe. Raise cattle, use our muscles. Men built like we are should be working out in the open.
   Happy: [avidly:] The Loman Brothers, heh?
   Biff:  [with vast affection:] Sure, we'd be known all over the countries!
   Happy: [enthralled:] That's what I dream about, Biff. Sometimes I want to walk into the middle of that store and just rip off my clothes and outbox that goddam merchandise manager, I mean I can outbox, outrun, and outlift anybody in that store, and I have to take orders from those common, petty son-of-bitches till I can't stand it any more.
   Biff:  I'm tellin' you, kid, if you were with me I'd happy out there.
   Happy: [enthused:] See, Biff, everybody around me is so false that I'm constantly lowering my ideas ...
   Biff:  Baby, together we'd stand up for one another, we'd have someone to trust.
   Happy: If I were around you --
   Biff:  Hap, the trouble is we weren't brought up to grub for money. I don't know how to do it.
   Happy: Neither do I!
   Biff:  Then let's go!
Lesson 160  Death Of A Salesman (¢ò)        

   The following scene is taken from Act One.
   Willy is almost gone when Biff, in his pajamas, comes down the stairs and enters the kitchen, where Linda is doing the chore.
   
   Biff:  What is he doing out there?
   Linda: Sh!
   Biff:  God Almighty, Mom, how long has he been doing this?
   Linda: Don't, he'll hear you.
   Biff:  What the hell is the matter with him?
   Linda: It'll pass by morning.
   Biff:  Shouldn't we do anything?
   Linda: Oh, my dear, you should do a lot of things, but there's nothing to do, so go to sleep.
  
   Happy comes down the stair and sits on the steps.
   Happy: I never heard him so loud, Mom.
   Linda: Well, come around more often, then you'll hear him. [She sits down at the table and mends the lining of Willy's jacket.]
   Biff:  Why didn't you ever write me about this, Mom?
   Linda: How would I write to you? For past three months you had no address.
   Biff:  I was on the move. But you know I thought about you all the time. You know that, pal?
   Linda: I know, dear, I know. But he likes to have a letter. There still a possibility for better things.
   Biff:  He's not like this all the time, is he?
   Linda: When you come home he's always the worst. When you write you're coming, he's all smiles, and talks about the future, and -- he's just wonderful. The closer you seem to come, the more shaky he gets. By the time you get here, he's arguing, and he seems angry at you. I think it's just that maybe he can't bring himself to open up to you. Why are you so hateful to each other? Why is that?
   Biff:  [evasively:] I'm not hateful, Mom.
   Linda: But no sooner you get into the door than you're fighting!
   Biff:  I don't know why. I mean to change. I'm tryin', Mom, you understand?
   Linda: Are you home to stay now?
   Biff:  I don't know. I want to look around, see what's doin'.
   Linda: Biff, you can't look around all you life, can you?
   Biff:  I just can't take hold, Mom. I can't take hold of some kind of a life.
   Linda: Biffe, a man is not a bird, to come and go with the springtime.
   Biff:  Your hair ... [He touches her hair.] Your hair got so gray, Mom.
   Linda: Oh, it's been gray since you were in high school. I just stopped dyeing it, that's all.
   Biff:  Dye it again, will ya? I don't want my pal looking old. [He smiles.]
   Linda: You're such a boy! You think you can go away for a year and ... You've got to get it into your head now that one day you'll knock on that door and there'll be strange people here --
   Biff:  What are you talking about? You're not even sixty, Mom.
   Linda: But what about your father?
   Biff:  [lamely.] Well, I meant him too.
   Happy: He admires Pop.
   Linda: Biff, dear, if you don't have any feeling for him, then you can't have any feeling for me.
   Biff:  Sure I can, Mom.
   Linda: No. You can't just come to see me, because I love him. [With a threat, but only a threat, of tears:] He's the dearest man in the world to me, and I won't have anyone making him fell unwanted and low and blue. You've got to make up your mind now, there's not leeway any more. Either he's your father and you pay him that respect, or you're not to come here. I know he's not easy to get along with -- nobody knows that better than me ...
   Willy: [from the left, with a laugh:] Hey, hey, Biffo!
   Biff:  [starting to go out after Willy:] What the hell is the matter with him? [Happy stops him.]
   Linda: Don't -- don't you go near him!
   Biff:  Stop making excuses for him! He always wiped the floor with you. Never had an ounce of respect for you.
   Happy: He's always had respect for -- 
   Biff:  What the hell do you know about it?
   Happy: [surlily:] Just don't call him crazy!
   Biff:  He's got no character -- Charley wouldn't do this. Not in his own house -- spewing out that vomit from his mind.
   Happy: Charley never had to cope with what he's got to.
   Biff:  People are worse off than Willy Loman. Believe me, I've seen them!
   Linda: Then make Charley your father, Biff. You can't do that, can you? I don't say he's a great man. Willy Loman never made a lot of money. His name was never in the papers. He's not the finest character that ever lived. But he's a human being, and a terrible thing is happening to him. So attention must be paid. He's not to be allowed to fall into his grave like an old dog. Attention, attention must be paid to such a person. You call him craze --
   Biff:  I didn't mean --
   Linda: No, a lot of people think he's lost his -- balance. But you don't have to be very smart to know what his trouble is. The man is exhausted. 
   Happy: Sure!
   Linda: A small man can be just as exhausted as a great man. He works for a firm thirty-six years this March, opens up unheard-of territories to their trademark, and now in his old age they take away his salary.
   Happy: [indignantly:] I didn't know that, Mom.
   Linda: You never asked, my dear! Now that you get your spending money someplace else you don't trouble your mind with him.
   Happy: But I gave you money last --
   Linda: Last Christmas time, fifty dollars! To fix the hot water heater it cost ninety-seven fifty! For the past five weeks he's been on a straight commission, like a beginner, an unknown!
   Biff:  Those ungrateful bastards!
   Linda: Are they any worse than his sons? When he brought them business, when he was young, they were glad to see him. But now his old friends, all the old buyers that loved him so and always managed to hand him some order in a pinch -- they're all dead, retired. He used to be able to make six, or seven calls a day in Boston. Now he takes his valises out of the car, puts them back, takes them out again and he's exhausted. Instead of walking he walks now. He drives seven hundred miles, and when he gets there no one knows him any more, no one welcomes him. What goes through a man's mind, driving seven hundred miles home without having earned a cent? Why shouldn't he talk to himself? Why? When he has to go to Charley and borrow fifty dollars a week and pretend to me that it's his pay? How long can that go on? How long? You see what I'm sitting here and waiting for? You tell me he has no character? The man who never worked a day but for your benefit? When does he get the medal for that? Is this his reward -- to turn around at the age of sixty-three and find his sons, who he loved better than his life, one a philandering bum --
   Happy: Mom!
   Linda: That's all you are, my baby! [To Biff:] And you! What happened to the love you had for him? You were such pals! How you used to talk to him on the phone every night! How lonely he was till he could come home to you!
   Biff:  All right, Mom. I'll live here in my room, and I'll get a job. I'll keep away from him, that's all.
   Linda: No, Biff. You can't stay here and fight all the time.
   Biff:  He threw me out of this house, remember that,
   Linda: Why was that? I never knew why.
   Biff:  Because I know he's a fake and he doesn't like anybody around who knows!
   Linda: Why a fake? In what way? What do you mean?
   Biff:  Just don't lay it all at my feet. It's between me and him -- that's all I have to say. I'll chip in from now on. He'll settle for half my pay check. He'll be all right. I'm going to bed. [He starts for the stairs.]
   Linda: He won't be all right.
   Biff:  [turning on the stairs, furiously:] I hate this city and I'll stay here. Now what do you want?
   Linda: He's dying, Biff.
